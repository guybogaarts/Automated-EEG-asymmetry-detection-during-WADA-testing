<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">LDA combination of BSI and rFBE&nbsp; <br></h2><div>Based
 on the results shown in figure 2, BSI calculated using electrode pair 
F3-F4, and rFBE based on electrode pair C3-C4 were combined using LDA into the 
final cBSI score. Figure 5 shows a scatterplot of all rFBE-BSI points, 
red points mark epochs labelled as ‘symmetric’ and green points 
epochs labelled as ‘asymmetric’. The orientation of the green points 
versus to the red points indicate that a (linear) combination of rFBE 
and BSI better separate ‘symmetric’ from ‘asymmetric’ epochs compared to either rFBE or BSI alone. 
In each LOO evaluation an LDA model was trained on a different subset of patients, consequently  different sets of LDA weights were found (BSI: 0.67+-0.01&nbsp; and rFBE 0.74 +- 0.01). Because the weights for rFBE and BSI were of similar magnitude, and optimized for the LOO training dataset and not for the left out patient, we simplified the linear combination of BSI and rFBE by simply taking the average of both (normalized) measures. This equates to  setting both LDA weights to 0.5 and this simplification did not result in statistically significant different results (p = 0.5, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). <br></div><div><br></div><div>The blue line in figure 5 indicates the direction perpendicular to the 
linear combination of rFBE and BSI. Depending on the desired sensitivity and specificity, a line perpendicular to the line in figure 5 can be used for classification. Furthermore, by varying this line, the ROC curve in Figure 6 is constructed. <br></div>
