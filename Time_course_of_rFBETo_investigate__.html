<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Time course of rFBE per EEG electrode (pair)<br></h2><div>To investigate why  asymmetry performance differed among the electrodes pairs, average time-courses of rFBE during the annotated period of asymmetry are shown in Figure 3. Every curve indicates the time course of rFBE, averaged over 85 injections, for each of the 8 left-right electrode pairs (solid), or midline electrodes (dashed).&nbsp;<span>Because of differences in duration of the marked 'asymmetric' periods, and we were interested in the average shape of the rFBE response, each rFBE response was scaled in time by interpolation before averaging. This means that every curve, after interpolation, has the same number of data points. Furthermore, from every curve, the rFBE value at t = 0 is subtracted. All curves show a steep increase to a maximum after the moment of injection followed by a nearly linear decline to baseline. The effect of amobarbital on delta activity is maximal for the central electrodes and minimal for the frontoparietal and frontal electrodes. This holds for both the amplitude and duration of the rFBE response.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><br></div>
