<div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Performance evaluation<br></h2><div>Performance will be evaluated for the ensemble of epochs from all patients as well as per patient individually. Each EEG epochs is considered an individual observation for which a BSI, rFBE and cBSI is calculated. By applying a detection threshold to one of the 3 QEEG methods, each epoch is classified as either 'symmetric' or 'asymmetric'. Using the annotations provided by the neurophysiologist, true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) are defined as the number of correctly classified symmetric and asymmetric epochs respectively. False positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) are defined as the number of incorrectly classified epochs respectively. Sensitivity and specificity are are defined according to equation 3 &amp; 4 and can be calculated for the complete dataset as well as for each patient separately. <br></div><div><span data-equation="Sensitivity=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(Sensitivity=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}\)</span><br></div><div><br></div><div><span data-equation="Specificity=\frac{TN}{TN+FP}" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(Specificity=\frac{TN}{TN+FP}\)</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>To evaluate classification performance, a ROC curve is obtained  by plotting sensitivity versus specificity for all possible detection thresholds [25]. The area under this curve (AUC) is then used as a performance measure. AUC ranges between 0.5 for random and 1 for perfect classification. <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
