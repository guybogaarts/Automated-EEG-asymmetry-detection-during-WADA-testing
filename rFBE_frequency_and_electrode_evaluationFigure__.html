<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">rFBE frequency and electrode evaluation<br></h2><div>Figure 2B shows the AUC value distributions for rFBE for each 
electrode pair, including the 3 midline electrodes. The best performance
 (median AUC = 0.96), is achieved by Cz and C3-C4 (p=0.42, Wilcoxon 
signed rank test). Also P3-P4 shows good performance (median AUC = 0.95)
 but is slightly worse compared to Cz (p=0.047, Wilcoxon signed rank 
test). Contrary to the BSI, which performs best using the frontal 
electrodes, rFBE performs best for the central, posterior and temporal 
regions. <br></div>
