<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Time course of rFBE<br></h2><div>Figure 3 shows the time course of rFBE, averaged over 85 injections, for each of the 8 left-right electrode pairs.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Because of differences in duration of the marked 'asymmetric' periods, each response is scaled in time and interpolation before averaging.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">All curves show a steep increase to a maximum after the moment of injection followed by a nearly linear decline to baseline. The effect of amobarbital on delta activity is maximal for the central electrodes and minimal for the frontoparietal and frontal electrodes. This holds for both the amplitude and duration of the rFBE response.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><br></div>
