<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" id="auto-label-subsection-466620">Time course of rFBE<br></h2><div>Figure 3 shows the time course of rFBE, averaged over 85 injections, for each of the 8 left-right electrode pairs. The effect of amobarbital on delta activity is maximal for the central electrodes and minimal for the frontoparietal and frontal electrodes. This holds for both the amplitude and duration of the rFBE response. <br></div><div><br></div>
