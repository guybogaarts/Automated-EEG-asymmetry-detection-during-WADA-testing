<div>First aim of our study is to evaluate the performance of asymmetry 
detection using a combination of two QEEG measures namely: BSI and 
relative EEG delta power.<br></div><div>Another important factor in 
asymmetry detection during Wada tests is the choice of electrodes. It is
 common to exclude certain electrodes beforehand because they are more 
prone to e.g. eye-movement artefacts (Frontoparietal), or because they 
are thought to be irrelevant for quantifying inter-hemispheric 
differences (midline electrodes Fz, Cz and Pz) ﻿<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Douw_2009,

 Wada tests  evaluate language and memory 
lateralisation and language is mainly located in the inferior frontal 
gyrus (Wernicke’s  or Broca’s area) and memory located in the 
temporal lobe, the temporal electrodes are likely to be of higher importance. 
Furthermore, contralateral EEG changes due to cross-filling occur mainly
 in the anterior cerebral artery region ﻿<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Tu_2015,

In our EEG 10-20 electrode setting we therefore evaluated asymmetry detection performance of each of the 19 electrodes, including the midline electrodes. Finally,
 asymmetry detection using QEEG has so far not explicitly been evaluated
 in terms of how it performs compared to visual EEG inspection. 
To evaluate this aspect, asymmetry annotated  during online Wada testing by a clinical neurophysiologist  were  used as   golden standard.  In this paper we aim to optimise  QEEG based asymmetry detection during Wada testing using the experienced clinical neurophysiologist's annotations as a golden standard. <br></div><div><br></div>
