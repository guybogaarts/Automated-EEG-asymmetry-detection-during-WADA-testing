<div>Regarding their relevance, our study evaluates the performance of asymmetry 
detection combining spatial BSI and 
relative EEG delta power. <br></div><div>Another important factor in 
asymmetry detection during Wada testing is the choice of EEG electrodes to include in the analysis.&nbsp;Wada tests  evaluate language and memory 
lateralisation and language is mainly located in the inferior frontal 
gyrus (Wernicke’s  or Broca’s area) and memory located in the 
temporal lobe. Therefore, the temporal electrodes are likely to be of higher importance. 
Furthermore, contralateral EEG changes due to cross-filling occur mainly
 in the anterior cerebral artery region ﻿<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Tu_2015,

 common to exclude certain electrodes beforehand because they are more 
prone to e.g. eye-movement artefacts (Frontoparietal), or because they 
are regarded to be irrelevant for quantifying inter-hemispheric 
differences (midline electrodes Fz, Cz and Pz) ﻿<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Douw_2009,

Finally,
 asymmetry detection using QEEG has so far not explicitly been evaluated
 in terms of how it performs compared to visual EEG inspection by a clinical neurophysiologist. 
To evaluate this aspect, asymmetry annotations provided by a clinical neurophysiologist  during online Wada testing were  used as   golden standard.<br></div>
