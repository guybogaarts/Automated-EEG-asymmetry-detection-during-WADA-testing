Therefore, in this study, the annotations provided by the clinical neuropsychologist  are used as the golden standard. Hence, quantitative EEG based asymmetry detection is optimized with respect to the clinical neuropsychologist's annotations. Our optimization is based on two quantitative EEG measures used for asymmetry detection during Wada test the Brain Symmetry Index (BSI) ﻿<cite class="squire-citation ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Peters_2012,
