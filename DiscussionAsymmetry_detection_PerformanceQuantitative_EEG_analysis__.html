Therefore, in this study, the annotations provided by the clinical neuropsychologist  are used as the golden standard. Hence, quantitative EEG based asymmetry detection is optimized with respect to the clinical neuropsychologist's annotations. Our optimization is based on two quantitative EEG measures used for asymmetry detection during Wada test the Brain Symmetry Index (BSI) <cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Peters_2012,

First, we evaluated which electrodes, when used to calculate BSI and rFBE, resulted in optimal asymmetry detection performance. In case of BSI, the electrode pair F3-F4 resulted in the highest performance of AUC = 0.96 (median value of 53 patients). Adding additional electrodes did not result in significant improvements. For rFBE, highest performance of AUC = 0.96 was achieved using either electrode pair C3-C4 or the midline electrode Cz. Second, the combination of BSI and rFBE using linear discriminant analysis revealed that by simply taking the average of both QEEG measures results in a relative performance increase of 50% (AUC = 0.98, median value of 53 patients). <br></div><div><br></div></div>
