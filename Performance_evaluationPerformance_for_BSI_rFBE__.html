<div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Performance evaluation<br></h2><div>Performance for BSI, rFBE and cBSI was evaluated for the ensemble of epochs from all patients, as well as per patient separately. Every single EEG epoch was considered an individual observation for which BSI, rFBE and cBSI were calculated. By applying a detection threshold to one of the 3 QEEG scores, each epoch was classified as either 'symmetric' or 'asymmetric'. Based on the annotations provided by the neurophysiologist, true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) are defined as the number of correctly classified symmetric and asymmetric epochs. False positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) are defined as the number of incorrectly classified asymmetric and symmetric epochs. Sensitivity and specificity are are defined according to equation 3 &amp; 4 and can be calculated for the complete dataset, as well as for each patient separately. <br></div><div><br></div><div><span data-equation="Sensitivity=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(Sensitivity=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}\)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equation 3<br></div><div><br></div><div><span data-equation="Specificity=\frac{TN}{TN+FP}" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(Specificity=\frac{TN}{TN+FP}\)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equation 4<br></div><div><br></div><div>To evaluate classification performance, a ROC curve is obtained  by plotting sensitivity versus specificity for all possible detection thresholds. The area under this curve (AUC) is then used as a performance measure. AUC ranges between 0.5 for random and 1 for perfect classification. Classification performance was evaluated by means of two different AUC 
values, method 1: calculated on all epochs in the dataset, and method 2: calculated 
per patient individually. The first yields one AUC value per asymmetry detection method, whereas the second yields 53 AUC values. Differences between asymmetry detection methods were tested for statistical significance  using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. To evaluate BSI classification performance including versus excluding a particular electrode pair, the non-parametric Wilcoxon ranked-sum test is used. P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. <br></div>
