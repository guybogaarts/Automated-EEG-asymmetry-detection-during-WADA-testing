The AUC value was calculated using the ensemble of all epochs from all patients. The left boxplot is the group where a particular  electrode pair was excluded (annotated at the top), and the right boxplot where this electrode pair was included in the set of electrodes used to calculate BSI. The horizontal blue line indicates the  AUC value for only the single annotated single 
electrode pair. When F3-F4 is included in a subset of other electrode pairs, AUC values are significantly higher compared to electrode subsets without F3-F4 (median AUC 0.83 vs. 0.89, p&lt;0.0001, 
Wilcoxon ranked sum test). Only 3 other electrode pair combinations, including F3-F4, yield higher performance (F3-F4 + P3-P4, F3-F4 + C3-C4, and F3-F4 + C3-C4 + O1-O2) compared to F3-F4 alone. However, when the AUC values were calculated per patient, the 
Wilcoxon signed rank test indicates that the differences in AUC values are not 
statistically significant (p = 0.52, p=0.57 and p=0.85). Figure 2A shows the AUC values for the 
BSI calculated using single left-right electrode pairs. Each boxplot
 indicates the distribution of the AUC values for the 53 patients. BSI based on electrode pair F3-F4 results in the highest median AUC value 
of 0.96 which is significantly higher compared to the other single electrode pairs (P&lt;1e-6, Wilcoxon signed rank). </span><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
