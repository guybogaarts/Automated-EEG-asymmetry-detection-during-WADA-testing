<h1 class="ltx_title_section"><b>Results</b><br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">BSI electrode subset evaluation<br></h2><div>Figure 1 shows overall AUC value distributions for BSI&nbsp;<span>for all possible electrode pair combinations divided in two groups. The AUC value is calculated using all epochs from all patients at once. The left boxplot is the group where the mentioned electrode pair is excluded and the right boxplot where this electrode pair is included. The central blue line indicates the  AUC value for just this single 
electrode pair. Clearly electrode pair F3-F4 has the highest single pair AUC as well as the highest AUC values for the group where this pair is included. When this electrode pair is not 
used in the BSI calculation, performance is significantly lower, 
irrespective of the other included electrode pairs (p&lt;0.0001, 
Wilcoxon ranked sum test). Only 3 other electrode pair combinations, including F3-F4, yield a slightly higher performance (P3-P4, C3-C4 and C3-C4 + O1-O2<b><i> </i></b>). However, when the AUC values are calculated per patient, the 
Wilcoxon signed rank test indicates that these differences are not 
statistically significant (p = 0.52, p=0.57 and p=0.85). The single electrode pair AUC for F3-F4 is statistically significantly different from all other 7 single electrode pairs. Figure 2A shows the AUC values for the 
BSI calculated using the single left-right electrode pairs. Each boxplot
 indicates the distribution of the AUC values for the 53 patients for 
each left-right electrode pair. BSI based on electrode pair F3-F4 results in the highest median AUC value 
of 0.96 (0.89 and 0.99, 25th and 75th percentile).&nbsp;</span><br></div>
