<h1 class="ltx_title_section"><b>Results</b><br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">BSI electrode subset evaluation<br></h2><div>Figure 1 shows overall AUC value distributions for BSI&nbsp;<span>for all possible electrode pair combinations divided in two groups. The AUC value was calculated using the ensemble of all epochs from all patients. The left boxplot is the group where a particular  electrode pair was excluded (annotated at the top), and the right boxplot where this electrode pair was included in the set of electrodes used to calculate BSI. The horizontal blue line indicates the  AUC value for only the single annotated single 
electrode pair. Electrode pair F3-F4 has the highest single pair AUC as well as the highest AUC values for the when this pair is included in a set of other electrodes. When this electrode pair is not 
used in the BSI calculation (boxplot F3-F4, excl.), performance is significantly lower compared to BSI calculated on F3-F4 alone, 
irrespective of the other included electrode pairs (p&lt;0.0001, 
Wilcoxon ranked sum test). Only 3 other electrode pair combinations, including F3-F4, yield a slightly higher performance (F3-F4 + P3-P4, F3-F4 + C3-C4 and F3-F4 + C3-C4 + O1-O2<b><i> </i></b>) compared to F3-F4 alone. However, when the AUC values were calculated per patient, the 
Wilcoxon signed rank test indicates that these differences are not 
statistically significant (p = 0.52, p=0.57 and p=0.85). Furthermore, the single electrode pair AUC for F3-F4 is statistically significantly different from all other 7 single electrode pairs. Figure 2A shows the AUC values for the 
BSI calculated using the single left-right electrode pairs. Each boxplot
 indicates the distribution of the AUC values for the 53 patients for 
each left-right electrode pair. BSI based on electrode pair F3-F4 results in the highest median AUC value 
of 0.96 (0.89 and 0.99, 25th and 75th percentile).&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><br></div>
