<div>where e and f indicate the electrode pair frequency bin respectively and L and R the power for a left and right electrode. BSI can be calculated using any combination of one or more left-right 
electrode pairs. With 8 left-right electrode pairs this yields a total 
of 255 combinations.&nbsp;To investigate the importance of a single 
electrode pair, all possible combinations including or excluding a 
particular pair are compared.<br></div><div><br></div>
