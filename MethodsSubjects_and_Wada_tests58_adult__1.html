 adult patients who underwent a Wada test between 2001 and 2012 at 
Maastricht University Medical centre were included. Five of these registrations 
were rejected due to poor quality of the EEG recording. Patients’ age 
ranged from 19 to 61 (37 ± 12. Mean ± standard deviation). Eleven <b><i>(of 16?)</i></b> patients were 
injected with 125 mg amobarbital and 42 patients with 150 mg. The 53 
patients received a total of 85 injections, 22 patients received 1 
injection, 30 patients received 2 and one patient 3 injections. After 
the amobarbital injection, a clinical neuropsychologist applies a series
 of memory and language tasks while a clinical neuropsychologist 
monitors and interprets the EEG. The memory and language tasks are 
stopped when the EEG is symmetric again, as indicated by the neuropsychologist. These time points are recorded and used to annotate 
the EEG. <br></div>
