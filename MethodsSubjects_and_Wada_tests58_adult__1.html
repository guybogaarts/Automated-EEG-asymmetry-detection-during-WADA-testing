 adult patients who underwent a Wada test between 2001 and 2012 at 
Maastricht University Medical centre were included. Five of these registrations 
were rejected due to poor quality of the EEG recording. Patients’ age 
ranged from 19 to 61 (37 ± 12. mean ± standard deviation). Eleven of the remaining 53 patients were 
injected with 125 mg amobarbital and 42 patients with 150 mg. In total the 53 
patients received  85 injections, 22 patients received 1 
injection, 30 patients received 2 and one patient 3 injections. After 
the amobarbital injection, a clinical neuropsychologist applied a series
 of memory and language tasks while an experienced clinical neurophysiologist
monitored and interpreted the EEG. The memory and language tasks were 
stopped when, as indicated by the  neurophysiologist, the EEG was symmetric again. These events were recorded and annotated 
the EEG. <br></div>
