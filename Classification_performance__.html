<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Classification performance<br></h2><div>Figure
 4 summarizes classification performance for BSI, rFBE and cBSI. Figure 
4A shows the ROC curves for the complete dataset. In figure 4B, AUC 
values are calculated for each of the 53 patient separately and their 
distributions displayed as boxplots. Both the higher area under the ROC 
curve and the per patient AUC values show that a significant improvement
 in classification can be accomplished by combining BSI and rFBE. The 
improvement in median AUC value from 0.96 to 0.98 (p = 0.0015, Wilcoxon 
signed rank test) equates to a relative improvement of 50%. The 
improvement from 0.91 to 0.95 in AUC calculated for the entire dataset 
is of similar magnitude (45%). <br></div>
