 to Figure 2A, shows the AUC value distributions for rFBE for each 
electrode pair, including the 3 midline electrodes. The best performance
 (median AUC = 0.96) is achieved by Cz and C3-C4 (p=0.42, Wilcoxon 
signed rank test). Also P3-P4 shows good performance (median AUC = 0.95)
 but is slightly worse compared to Cz (p=0.047, Wilcoxon signed rank 
test). Contrary to the BSI score which performs best using the frontal 
electrodes, rFBE performs best for the central, posterior and temporal 
regions. <br></div><div>LDA combination of BSI and rFBE <br></div><div>Based
 on the results shown in figure 2, BSI calculated using electrode pair 
F3-F4 and rFBE based on electrode C3-C4 are combined using LDA into the 
final cBSI score. Figure 3 shows a scatterplot of all rFBE-BSI points, 
red points illustrates epochs labeled as ‘symmetric’ and green points 
epochs labeled as ‘asymmetric’. The orientation of the green points 
relative to the red points indicate that a (linear) combination of rFBE 
and BSI better separates ‘symmetric’ from ‘asymmetric’ epochs. This is 
confirmed by the LDA model which assigns equal weights to rFBE and BSI. 
The blue line in figure 3 indicates the direction perpendicular to the 
linear combination of rFBE and BSI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div>Classification performance<br></div><div><br></div><div>Figure

 4 summarizes classification performance for BSI, rFBE and cBSI. Figure 
4A shows the ROC curves for the complete dataset. In figure 4B, AUC 
values are calculated for each of the 53 patient separately and their 
distributions displayed as boxplots. Both the higher area under the ROC 
curve and the per patient AUC values show that a significant improvement
 in classification can be accomplished by combining BSI and rFBE. The 
improvement in median AUC value from 0.96 to 0.98 (p = 0.0015, Wilcoxon 
signed rank test) equates to a relative improvement of 50%. The 
improvement from 0.91 to 0.95 in AUC calculated for the entire dataset 
is of similar magnitude (45%). <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Figure 4. ROC curves (A) and AUC distributions for BSI, rFBE and cBSI. Each box<br></div>
