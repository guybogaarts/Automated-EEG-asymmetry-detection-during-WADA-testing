This is task is usually performed by a clinical <br></div><div>neuropsychologist. Therefore, the annotations provided by the clinical neuropsychologist online during the Wada tests are as golden standard. Hence, quantitative EEG based asymmetry detection is optimized with respect to the clinical neuropsychologist's annotations.&nbsp; <br><br></div><div><br></div>
