 The 3 midline electrodes Fz, Cz and Fz are evaluated as well to obtain a
 complete overview of all electrodes without excluding potential useful 
information beforehand. To exclude the injection side from the QEEG measure, the maximum of each left-right electrode pair is taken. 
This yields, including the 3 midline electrodes, a total of 11 relative 
FBE (rFBE).&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div>The goal of using QEEG 
measures as a monitoring tool is to mimic the visual evaluation of the 
clinical neurophysiologist, i.e. classifying each EEG epoch as either 
symmetric or asymmetric. Therefore, BSI and rFBE need to be combined 
in a single ‘BSI’ score (cBSI). Linear discriminant analysis&nbsp; (LDA) 
is a method of optimizing the separation of two classes by finding a linear combination of a set of features <cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@book{McLachlan_1992,

 A KF is an algorithm that uses a series of noisy measurements (BSI 
scores) to produce estimates of an underlying system (actual hemispheric
 inactivation) state being more precise then when based on single 
measurements alone. <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Performance evaluation<br></h2><div><br></div>
