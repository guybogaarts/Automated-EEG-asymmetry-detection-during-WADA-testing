<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Time course of BSI per frequency band in F3-F4<br></h2><div><div>Similarly to the averaged rFBE responses per EEG electrode pair, Figure 4 shows the averaged BSI response split up per frequency band for electrode pair F3-F4. For the lowest frequency band, the BSI response has a delayed onset and returns to baseline at roughly 2/3 of the total asymmetry period. BSI based on the power in the 2-4 Hz band has the highest average response but also returns to baseline before the end of the asymmetry period. The most prominent observation id the course of the BSI response of the two higher frequency bands which continue to rise when the other frequency BSI score start to decline. As described in the methods section, the BSI score is calculated on all frequency bands from 0.5 to 12 Hz. Therefore, this BSI score is the average of the curves shown in Figure 4. Furthermore, BSI scores calculated on all frequency bands performed significantly better compared to separate frequency bands.
