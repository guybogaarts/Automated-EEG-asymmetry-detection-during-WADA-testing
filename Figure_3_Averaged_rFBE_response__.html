<div>Figure 3. Averaged rFBE response after 
amobarbital injection for the entire period marked as 'asymmetric'. Each
 curve is the average of the 85 responses. Because of differences in 
duration of the 'asymmetric' periods, each response is scaled in time 
and interpolation before averaging.<br></div>
