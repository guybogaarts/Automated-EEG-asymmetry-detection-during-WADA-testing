 2A shows the AUC values for the 
BSI calculated using single left-right electrode pairs. Each boxplot
 indicates the distribution of the AUC values for the 53 patients. BSI 
based on electrode pair F3-F4 results in the highest median AUC value 
of 0.96 which is significantly higher compared to the other single 
electrode pairs (P&lt;1e-6, Wilcoxon signed rank). <br></div>
