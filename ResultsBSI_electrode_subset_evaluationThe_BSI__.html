 BSI can be calculated using any combination of one or more left-right 
electrode pairs. With 8 left-right electrode pairs this yields a total 
of 255 combinations.&nbsp; To investigate the importance of a single 
electrode pair, all possible combinations including or excluding a 
particular pair are compared. Figure 1 shows, for each left-right 
electrode pair, the overall AUC value distributions for the BSI 
calculated for all possible electrode pair combinations excluding (left 
boxplot) or including (right boxplot) a particular electrode pair. The 
blue line indicates the AUC value for the BSI based on a single 
electrode pair. The most prominent observation in figure 1 is the 
importance of the electrode pair F3-F4. When this electrode pair is not 
used in the BSI calculation, performance is significantly lower, 
irrespective of the other included electrode pairs (p&lt;0.0001, 
Wilcoxon ranked sum test). Only 3 other electrode pair combinations 
yield a slightly higher performance (F3-F4 + P3-P4, or C3-C4, or C3-C4 
and O1-O2).&nbsp; However, when the AUC is calculated per patient, the 
Wilcoxon signed rank test indicates that these difference are not 
statistically significant (p = 0.52, p=0.57 and p=0.85). Difference 
between F3-F4 and the 7 other single electrode pairs, on the other hand,
 are statistically significant. Figure 2A shows the AUC values for the 
BSI calculated using the single left-right electrode pairs. Each boxplot
 indicates the distribution of the AUC values for the 53 patients for 
each left-right electrode pair. As can be seen in figure 2A, for the 53 
patients, BSI based on electrode pair F3-F4 achieves a median AUC value 
of 0.96 (0.89 and 0.99, 25th and 75th percentile). <br></div>
