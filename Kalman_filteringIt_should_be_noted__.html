<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" id="auto-label-subsection-362771">Kalman filtering<br></h2><div>It should be noted that this performance was achieved only after a Kalman Filter was used to smooth the BSI and rFBE time series. Without this smoothing, AUC values of 0.84 and 0.87 were found for BSI and rFBE respectively. Applying a Kalman filter is therefore essential for accurate asymmetry detection because it results in a relative performance increase of 41% for BSI and 26% for rFBE.<br></div><div><br></div>
