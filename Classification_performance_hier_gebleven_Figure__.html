<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Classification performance [hier gebleven]<br></h2><div>Figure
 6 summarizes classification performance for BSI, rFBE and cBSI. Figure 
4A shows the ROC curves for the complete dataset (method 1). In figure 4B, AUC 
values are calculated for each of the 53 patient separately and their 
distributions displayed as boxplots (method 2). Both the higher area under the ROC 
curve and the per patient AUC values show that a significant improvement
 in classification can be accomplished by combining BSI and rFBE. This improvement is reflected in the AUC values calculated for the entire dataset (from 0.91 to 0.95) as well as in the AUC values calculated per patient (from 0.96 to 0.98, p = 0.0015, Wilcoxon 
signed rank test). Furthermore, improvement in median AUC value&nbsp; equates to a relative improvement of 50%, which is of similar magnitude to the 45%&nbsp; 
improvement&nbsp; in AUC calculated for the entire dataset, 
is of similar magnitude (45%).<br></div>
