 the spectral density of eleven 2Hz bins ranging from 0 to 16 Hz (1 Hz 
overlap) was calculated for each EEG channel. Second, the absolute left 
(L) 
minus right (R) difference divided by their sum is calculated for each 
electrode pair at each 2 Hz bin are calulated. Third, these values are  
averaged, first over the 8 
electrode pairs and subsequently over the 11 frequency bins. <br></div></div><div><br></div>
